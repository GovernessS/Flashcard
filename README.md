## Flashcard App

## Lab 2

### App Description
A functional flashcard app. Selecting the visibility icon reveals (and hides) the answer selection for the question presented. After selecting an answer, instant feedback is provided on whether the answer was correct. Selecting the "add" icon at the bottom allows users to enter a new question (and corresponding correct/incorrect answers). The question that is being displayed can be edited and revised, and constraints were integrated into the editing page so that each text field must be filled in prior to submitting a card. The user also received notifications if a field is not entered, as well as when a card has been successfully built. Currently, only one question can be shown at a time as a proof-of-concept.
